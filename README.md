# Stimulus-Response-Tester
This Python program interfaces with buzzers (specifically, those from the PS2 game "Buzz!"), prompts users with either auditory, visual, or textual stimuli and collects data of response time relative to each type of stimulus. It was used in a science project to compare the response times/accuracy to auditory, visual, and textual stimuli.

Buzzers used in this program are from the game "Buzz!" for Sony's Playstation 2. The program XPadder (http://www.xpadder.com) was used to map keys to the USB Buzzer's inputs. XPadder configuration profiles are included.
